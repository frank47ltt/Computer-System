What? Over? Did you say over? Nothing is over until we decide it is. Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbour? Hell no.
 And it ain't over now, 'cause when the going gets tough... 
(Awkward pause) the tough get going. Who's with me? Let's go, come on, heeeyyy! 
(No one follows him as he charges out of the door. He skulks back in). 
What happened to the Delta that I used to know? Where's the spirit? Where's the guts? Huh? This could be the greatest night of our lives, but you're gonna let it be the worst. 
(Affects cowardly voice) "Oh, we're afraid to go with you Bluto, we might get in trouble." 
Well just kiss my butt from now on. Not me, I'm not gonna take this. Wormer, he's a dead man; Marmalard, dead; Neidermeyer, dead; Java programming, dead...
